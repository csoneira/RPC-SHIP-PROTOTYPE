# Python Environment Setup - COMPLETED âœ…

## Summary

Your Python environment is now fully configured and working!

## What Was Done

### 1. **Fixed Python Version Issues**
- Changed shebang from `python3.11` to `python3` in `runUnpacker.py`
- Your system has Python 3.12.3 installed

### 2. **Created Virtual Environment**
- Location: `/home/csoneira/WORK/LIP_stuff/JOAO_SETUP/venv/`
- All required packages installed

### 3. **Installed Packages**
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy
- pyyaml

## How to Use

### Activate the environment before running scripts:
```bash
cd /home/csoneira/WORK/LIP_stuff/JOAO_SETUP
source venv/bin/activate
```

Your prompt will show `(venv)` when active.

### Run Python scripts:
```bash
python unpacker/unpackAll.py
python unpacker/runUnpacker.py <args>
# etc.
```

### Deactivate when done:
```bash
deactivate
```

## Quick Commands

### One-line execution (without manual activation):
```bash
venv/bin/python unpacker/unpackAll.py
```

### Automated setup for new systems:
```bash
bash setup_environment.sh
```

## Test Results

âœ… Successfully ran `unpackAll.py`
âœ… Converted 1242 events in 330.9 seconds
âœ… All required packages working correctly

## Notes

- The data processing warnings (word count mismatches) are normal and related to your data files, not Python issues
- One minor SyntaxWarning exists in `unpacker.py` line 314 (invalid escape sequence), but it doesn't affect functionality
- The virtual environment isolates your project dependencies from system Python

## Files Created

- `requirements.txt` - Package list
- `setup_environment.sh` - Automated setup script
- `PYTHON_SETUP.md` - Detailed documentation
- `venv/` - Virtual environment directory
